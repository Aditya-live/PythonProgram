Dirichlets theorem

eulers totient function

from 0 to 43 we have 20 numbers which are co prime to 44
there fore we write phy(44)=20 phy is euler's totient funtion
all those numbers which are copriem are called "totatives"

6 rad is close to full turn, 44 rad is more close to a full turn, 710 is extremely close to a full turn.

phy(710)=710(1/2)(4/5)(70/71)=280 hence those 280 lines
